    <h1>To the one who made me feel loved in ways I never saw coming — Smaggy,</h1>

    <p>I honestly don’t know what life has planned for us. Maybe this is just a short, beautiful chapter. Maybe it ends here. Or maybe, somehow, it doesn’t. But whatever it is… I just need you to know how insanely lucky I feel to have met you.</p>

    <p>You’re not mine — I know that. But still, you have my heart in the softest, realest way.</p>
    <p>I fell for you because you’re you. You’re the way you are and I love you for that.</p>
    
    <p>I love you for the way you make me feel. I love you for the way you make me laugh. I love you for the way you make me feel like I’m the luckiest girl in the world.</p>

    <p>I love you for the way you make me feel like I can be myself. I love you for the way you make me feel like I can be better. I love you for the way you make me feel like I can be everything I want to be.</p>  
    
    <p>You came into my life unexpectedly, and you lit up parts of me I’d forgotten existed. You made everything feel lighter, safer, more alive. I know we’re not perfect. We’re not even close. But I love you, Smaggy. I love you for who you are, and I love you for who you are becoming. We built love in the most meaningful way we could, and I cherish the way you love me. No matter what happens next, I’ll hold that close.</p>

    <p>We both have our lives, our own choices, our own futures. And if someday I’m no longer part of your story — if distance or time pulls us apart — just know that I’ll always be quietly cheering you on from wherever I am.</p>

    <p>I love you, Smaggy. I love you more than you’ll ever know. I love you more than words can express.</p>

    <p>Please keep chasing your dreams. Keep becoming everything you're meant to be.<br>
    Take care of that beautiful soul of yours.</p>

    <p>Thank you for letting me love you, even for this little while.<br>
      Thank you for being you, Baby Smaggy.<br>
    It meant more than I can ever explain. See you soon.</p>

    <p>I love you always, My Love. 💖</p>
